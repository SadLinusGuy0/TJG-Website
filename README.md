# That Josh Guy's Website

This is where the files of my website, both current and legacy, will be stored.

Keep your eyes peeled for updates and easter eggs ðŸ‘€

Legacy site developed in conjunction with Dhiren Vasnani. Check out his socials here:

## Beta Next.js version

The `beta/` directory contains an experimental Next.js rewrite of the site.
Binary assets were removed from version control to keep patches text-only.
Add your own images under `beta/public/` when experimenting locally.
Run it locally with:

```bash
cd beta
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Running Tests

Install dependencies and run the Jest test suite:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```
